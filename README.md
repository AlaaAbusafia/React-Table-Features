# Archipro frontend code challenge


![Screen](https://archipro.co.nz/themes/archipro2/images/archipro_dev.png)

Welcome to the ArchiPro coding exercise (challenge) for front-end developers!

We appreciate your time in completing this exercise. It is an important part of our recruitment process and a great way for you to demonstrate your development skills to us. It also means we can have a more meaningful conversation with you if you are successful in moving through to an interview.

How does the coding exercise work?
  *	You'll need to set aside a couple of hours
  *	Complete the exercise and show us your programming skills and thought processes â€¦ there are plenty of opportunities to impress us!
  *	When we see your pull request we'll acknowledge it. Then we'll review it.
  *	You'll hear back from us with an outcome, probably by email.  If we think your skills are what we're looking for then we'll be in contact to set up an interview.

Have fun! We look forward to seeing your work.

## Instructions

  1. You are welcome to use any resources you have available.
  2. We want to see how you **work through the feature request we provide below**.
  3. Choose a time when **you can work for two hours uninterrupted and without distractions**. We'll check the timestamps on your commits to get a feel for how long things took. If you get interrupted, that will throw your times off, so please try to work steadily for two hours.
  4. You can put in more time if you want to, but **two hours is the recommended time**. You don't have to finish the feature - in fact, you are unlikely to. Get as far as you can in the time you have available.
  5. Do the best work you can. **It's not just about the code.** Show us all your moves! We'll be looking at the big picture: What's your thinking pattern? What attention do you give to others? How well would you work with others? And more.

## The Task

**Add ONE feature to the App.** You could make the columns sortable in one or both directions. Or you could add a search feature, or a filter that filters by rows. What about pagination? That's an option. It's up to you, but try to choose something that you can make reasonable progress on in two hours. Or, if you're already an expert in this code, the sky's the limit. Impress us. P.S. You will have find a lot more fields available for you to use under /src/api/data.json.

## Bonus Points

* Clean code.
* Tests.
* Knowledge of application flow.
* Knowledge of modern best practices/coding patterns.
* Demonstration of good state management.
* Usage of frameworks/supersets.
* Pixel perfection.
* Componential thinking.
* Animations - the mind browing kind 


## Requirements

You'll need a recent version of **[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**, a good text editor (**[Atom](https://atom.io/)**, **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**, etc.), and a recent browser (**[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)**, **[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)**, etc.). Optionally, you can install **[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)**, but **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** will work as well. It will really help. [React DevTools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) can also be useful.

## Procedure and tips
* **Make frequent commits. Make frequent commits. Make frequent commits!** We want to see how your code develops and how much time you spent on each part.
* **Document your thinking.** (Use comments in the code, preferably).
* When you're sure you're ready, **zip up your files and put them somewhere where we can find them**. Dropbox? Your own GitHub account? Include a note telling us what you did and why. Make sure to include anything you want us to consider when reviewing your code.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT include the `node_modules` folder in your zip file!** We can install the dependencies ourselves.
