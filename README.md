Welcome to the ArchiPro coding exercise (challenge) for front-end developers!

We appreciate your time in completing this exercise. It is an important part of our recruitment process and a great way for you to demonstrate your development skills to us. It also means we can have a more meaningful conversation with you if you are successful in moving through to an interview.

How does the coding exercise work?
  *	You'll need to set aside a couple of hours
  *	Complete the exercise and show us your programming skills and thought processes â€¦ there are plenty of opportunities to impress us!
  *	When we see your pull request we'll acknowledge it. Then we'll review it.
  *	You'll hear back from us with an outcome, probably by email.  If we think your skills are what we're looking for then we'll be in contact to set up an interview.

Have fun! We look forward to seeing your work.
